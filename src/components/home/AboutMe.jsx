          <p className="lead">As a values-driven software engineer, educator and creative thinker, I have a passion for leveraging technology to serve people and change the world. I take pride and satisfaction in a job well-done, but also continuously pursue the next improvement. From my background as an educator, I know the importance of relationship building and collaboration to a teamâ€™s ability to deliver outstanding results on projects. I bring a wealth of organizational and collaborative soft skills as well as a full-suite of front- and backend web development abilities to the job. On a personal level, I relish creating things and diving into new adventures, a passion I carry into every new role.</p>
